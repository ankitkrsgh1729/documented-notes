# URL Shortener Architecture - Detailed Component Explanation

## 1. Client-Facing Layer

### Client
- **Description**: End users accessing the URL shortener through web browsers or mobile apps
- **Purpose**: Consumes the API to create shortened URLs and accesses shortened URLs for redirection
- **Technical Considerations**: Supports various platforms (web, mobile, API clients)
- **Interactions**: Communicates with CDN for static content and API Gateway for dynamic operations

### CDN (Content Delivery Network)
- **Description**: Globally distributed network of proxy servers
- **Purpose**: Delivers static assets (JS, CSS, images) with low latency; may also cache frequent redirects
- **Technical Considerations**: Reduces load on application servers; provides edge caching for faster response times
- **Implementations**: CloudFront, Cloudflare, Akamai, Fastly
- **Scaling**: Automatically scales based on traffic patterns across geographic regions

### API Gateway
- **Description**: Entry point for all API requests to the system
- **Purpose**: Routes requests to appropriate services, manages authentication, and applies rate limiting
- **Components**:
  - **Token Validation**: Verifies JWT tokens issued by Auth Service
  - **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting requests per client/IP
  - **Request Routing**: Directs traffic based on path and version
  - **Response Transformation**: Standardizes API responses
- **Technical Considerations**: 
  - Handles API versioning (/api/v1/*, /api/v2/*)
  - Provides API documentation through OpenAPI/Swagger
  - Implements consistent error handling
- **Implementations**: Kong, Amazon API Gateway, Apigee, custom implementation
- **Scaling**: Horizontally scalable, stateless component

## 2. Application Services

### URL Shortener Service

- **Purpose**: Creates and stores mappings between short codes and original URLs
- **Endpoints**: `/api/v1/shorten`
- **Key Functions**:
  - Short code generation (random or custom)
  - Collision detection and handling
  - URL validation
  - Storage of URL mappings
- **Technical Considerations**: Uses consistent hashing algorithms for code generation
- **Scaling**: Stateless service that can be horizontally scaled

### URL Redirect Service
- **Description**: Service that handles redirection requests for shortened URLs
- **Purpose**: Retrieves original URLs and redirects users
- **Endpoints**: `/api/v1/{code}`
- **Key Functions**:
  - Lookup of original URL by short code
  - HTTP redirects (301 permanent or 302 temporary)
  - Click tracking
- **Technical Considerations**: Optimized for high read throughput

## 3. Data Management Layer

### Redis Cache Cluster
- **Description**: In-memory data structure store used as cache
- **Purpose**: Provides fast access to frequently requested URL mappings
- **Key Functions**:
  - Caching URL mappings to reduce database load
  - Supporting high throughput for URL lookups
  - Temporary data storage (rate limiting counters, etc.)
- **Structure**:
  - Multiple nodes in master-replica configuration
  - Sharded for horizontal scaling
- **Technical Considerations**: 
  - Despite being single-threaded, extremely efficient for URL lookup operations
  - Handles power-law distribution of URL accesses (small % of URLs get majority of traffic)
  - Configured with appropriate eviction policies and TTLs
- **Implementations**: Redis Cluster, AWS ElastiCache, Azure Cache for Redis
- **Scaling**: Both vertical (larger instances) and horizontal (more shards)

### Database Proxy
- **Description**: Middleware layer between application and database
- **Purpose**: Manages database connections and abstracts sharding complexity
- **Components**:
  - **Shard Router**: Determines which database shard contains data based on hash key
  - **Connection Pool**: Efficiently manages database connections
  - **Query Cache**: Optional caching of frequent queries
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Implements consistent hashing for shard routing
  - Provides query load balancing
  - Handles shard failover and recovery
- **Implementations**: ProxySQL, Vitess, custom middleware
- **Scaling**: Scaled based on database query volume

### Database Shards
- **Description**: Partitioned database instances, each containing a subset of URL mappings
- **Purpose**: Horizontal scaling of database capacity
- **Key Functions**:
  - Persistent storage of URL mappings
  - ACID-compliant transactions
  - Data redundancy through replication
- **Technical Considerations**:
  - Data partitioned by hash of short code
  - Each shard is independently scalable
  - May use primary-replica configuration for high availability
- **Implementations**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling by adding more shards; vertical scaling for individual shards

### Message Queue
- **Description**: Asynchronous message broker

## 4. Key Data Flows

### URL Shortening Flow
1. Client sends request to API Gateway to shorten a URL
2. API Gateway authenticates request and routes to URL Shortener Service
3. URL Shortener Service checks Redis Cache to see if URL already exists
4. If cache miss, service checks database via DB Proxy
5. If URL is new, service generates unique short code
6. Mapping is stored in database and added to cache
7. URL created event is published to Message Queue
8. Short URL is returned to client

### URL Redirection Flow
1. Client requests short URL
2. Request routed through API Gateway to URL Redirect Service
3. Service checks Redis Cache for original URL mapping
4. If cache hit, redirect is performed immediately
5. If cache miss, service queries database via DB Proxy
6. Original URL is returned and added to cache
7. URL accessed event is published to Message Queue
8. Client is redirected to original URL

### Analytics Processing Flow
1. URL events are published to Message Queue
2. Analytics Processor consumes events from queue
3. Processor enriches and aggregates data
4. Processed data is stored in Analytics Database
5. Analytics API provides query access to processed data

### Authentication Flow
1. Client sends authentication request to API Gateway
2. API Gateway routes to Auth Service
3. Auth Service validates credentials against Auth Database
4. Upon successful authentication, JWT token is generated
5. Token is returned to client
6. Client uses token for subsequent requests
7. API Gateway validates token for protected endpoints

## 5. Scaling Considerations

### Traffic Patterns
- **Read-heavy workload**: Typically 100:1 or higher ratio of reads (redirects) to writes (URL creation)
- **Power-law distribution**: Small percentage of URLs receive majority of traffic
- **Temporal patterns**: Traffic may spike based on viral content or campaigns

### Scaling Strategies
- **Horizontal scaling**: Adding more instances of stateless services
- **Database sharding**: Partitioning data across multiple database instances
- **Caching**: Leveraging Redis for frequently accessed URLs
- **CDN**: Offloading static content and potentially hot redirects
- **Asynchronous processing**: Using Message Queue to handle traffic spikes

### Performance Optimizations
- **Read replicas**: For database read scaling
- **Cache warming**: Pre-populating cache with popular URLs
- **Request coalescing**: Combining duplicate requests for same URL during cache misses
- **Geographic distribution**: Deploying services closer to users
- **Database indexes**: Optimizing for lookup patterns
