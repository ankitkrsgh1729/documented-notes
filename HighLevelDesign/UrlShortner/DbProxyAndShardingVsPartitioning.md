# DB Proxy for Sharding & Sharding vs Partitioning

## Why DB Proxy for Sharding?

### **Without DB Proxy (Application-Level Sharding)**
```
App → Direct connections to multiple DB shards
```
**Problems:**
- **Connection pooling complexity** - Need separate pools for each shard
- **Shard logic in every app** - Duplicate routing code
- **Cross-shard queries difficult** - App must handle aggregation
- **Operational overhead** - Each app manages shard topology

### **With DB Proxy**
```
App → DB Proxy → Multiple DB shards
```
**Benefits:**
- **Centralized shard logic** - Single place for routing rules
- **Connection pooling** - Proxy manages all shard connections
- **Transparent to apps** - Apps see single database endpoint
- **Cross-shard operations** - Proxy can handle joins/aggregations
- **Easy shard management** - Add/remove shards without app changes

## When to Use DB Proxy vs Application-Level

### **Use DB Proxy When:**
- **Multiple applications** accessing same sharded data
- **Complex cross-shard queries** needed
- **Dynamic shard management** (frequent adding/removing shards)
- **Legacy applications** that can't easily implement shard logic
- **Operational simplicity** preferred over performance

### **Use Application-Level When:**
- **Single application** or tight control over data access
- **Performance critical** (one less network hop)
- **Simple shard logic** (e.g., user_id based routing)
- **No cross-shard operations** needed
- **Team has strong database expertise**

## Sharding vs Partitioning

### **Partitioning (Vertical/Horizontal)**
- **Scope**: Single database instance
- **Purpose**: Organize data within one DB for performance
- **Examples**: 
  - Table partitioning by date ranges
  - Separate tables by data type
- **Managed by**: Database engine

### **Sharding**
- **Scope**: Multiple database instances/servers
- **Purpose**: Distribute data across separate databases
- **Examples**:
  - User data split by user_id across 4 DB servers
  - Geographic sharding (US, EU, APAC databases)
- **Managed by**: Application or DB proxy

## Popular DB Proxy Solutions

### **Open Source**
- **ProxySQL** (MySQL)
- **PgBouncer** (PostgreSQL connection pooler)
- **Vitess** (MySQL sharding platform)

### **Cloud Solutions**
- **AWS RDS Proxy**
- **Azure Database Proxy**
- **Google Cloud SQL Proxy**

## Example: Shard Selection Logic

### Application-Level
```python
def get_shard(user_id):
    shard_id = user_id % 4  # 4 shards
    return connections[f"shard_{shard_id}"]

user_db = get_shard(user_id)
user_data = user_db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", user_id)
```

### DB Proxy Level
```sql
-- App sends normal query
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 12345;

-- Proxy routes to appropriate shard based on configured rules
-- App doesn't know about sharding
```

## Key Takeaway

**DB Proxy** = Operational simplicity, transparency, cross-shard capabilities
**Application-Level** = Performance, control, simplicity for single apps

Choose based on your **team size**, **operational complexity**, and **performance requirements**!
