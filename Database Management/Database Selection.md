# Database Selection Criteria for Different Use Cases

### Key Decision Factors

#### 1. Data Structure and Relationships
**Highly Structured with Complex Relationships** → **SQL/Relational**
- Example: E-commerce (customers, orders, products, inventory)
- Multiple foreign keys, joins needed
- Need for referential integrity

**Semi-structured or Flexible Schema** → **Document DB**
- Example: Content management, user profiles, product catalogs
- JSON-like data, varying fields per record
- Rapid development, schema evolution

**Simple Key-Value Pairs** → **Key-Value Store**
- Example: Session storage, caching, configuration
- High-speed lookups by unique identifier
- No complex queries needed

**Graph-like Relationships** → **Graph Database**
- Example: Social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection
- Many-to-many relationships, path finding
- Relationship queries more important than entity queries

---

#### 2. Scalability Requirements

**Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)** → **SQL Databases**
- Increase server power (CPU, RAM, storage)
- Good for: Medium-scale applications, complex queries
- Example: Enterprise ERP, CRM systems
- **Limitation**: Hardware limits, single point of failure

**Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)** → **NoSQL Databases**
- Add more servers to handle load
- Good for: Web-scale applications, high traffic
- Example: Social media platforms, IoT data collection
- **Advantage**: Nearly unlimited scaling potential

**Real-world Example**:
```
Small Startup (1K users): PostgreSQL on single server ✓
Growing Company (100K users): PostgreSQL with read replicas ✓
Large Scale (10M users): Switch to Cassandra + Redis ✓
```

#### 3. Consistency vs Availability Trade-offs (CAP Theorem)

**Strong Consistency Required** → **SQL Databases**
- Financial transactions, inventory management
- ACID compliance is non-negotiable
- Example: Banking systems, e-commerce checkout

**High Availability Required** → **NoSQL Databases**
- Social media feeds, content delivery
- Can tolerate eventual consistency
- Example: Facebook posts, Twitter timeline

**Partition Tolerance Required** → **Distributed NoSQL**
- Global applications, must survive network failures
- Example: Netflix content delivery, global gaming platforms

---

#### 4. Query Complexity

**Complex Queries with Joins** → **SQL Databases**
```sql
-- Complex reporting query
SELECT c.name, COUNT(o.id) as order_count, SUM(oi.price * oi.quantity) as total_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
WHERE o.created_at > '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY c.id, c.name
HAVING total_spent > 1000;
```

**Simple Read/Write Operations** → **NoSQL Databases**
```javascript
// Simple document retrieval
db.users.findOne({email: "john@example.com"});
// Simple key-value lookup
redis.get("user:123:session");
```

---

#### 5. Performance Requirements

**Sub-millisecond Response Times** → **In-Memory Databases**
- Redis, Memcached
- Example: Real-time gaming, financial trading, ad serving
- **Trade-off**: Limited by RAM size, higher cost

**High Write Throughput** → **Column-Family Databases**
- Cassandra, HBase
- Example: IoT sensor data, time-series data, logging
- **Trade-off**: Complex queries are difficult

**Balanced Read/Write** → **Document Databases**
- MongoDB, CouchDB
- Example: Content management, user profiles
- **Trade-off**: Less ACID compliance than SQL

### Decision Matrix

| Use Case | Primary Factor | Recommended DB | Why |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-----|
| **Banking System** | ACID Compliance | PostgreSQL | Strong consistency, transactions |
| **Social Media Feed** | High Availability | Cassandra + Redis | Scale, eventual consistency OK |
| **E-commerce Catalog** | Flexible Schema | MongoDB | Product variations, rapid changes |
| **Real-time Chat** | Low Latency | Redis + WebSockets | In-memory speed |
| **Analytics/Reporting** | Complex Queries | PostgreSQL/BigQuery | SQL power, aggregations |
| **IoT Data Collection** | Write Throughput | InfluxDB/Cassandra | Time-series optimization |
| **Content Management** | Schema Flexibility | MongoDB | Varying content types |
| **Session Storage** | Simple K-V Lookup | Redis | Fast, TTL support |
| **Fraud Detection** | Relationship Analysis | Neo4j | Graph relationships |
| **Gaming Leaderboards** | Sorted Sets | Redis | Built-in ranking operations |

### Real-World Selection Examples

#### Example 1: Netflix Architecture
**Problem**: Stream videos to 200M+ users globally
**Solution**: 
- **Cassandra**: User viewing history (high write volume)
- **MySQL**: Billing, account management (ACID needed)
- **Redis**: Caching, session management (speed)
- **Elasticsearch**: Search functionality (full-text search)

**Why this works**: Each database optimized for its specific use case

#### Example 2: Uber Architecture
**Problem**: Real-time ride matching, location tracking
**Solution**:
- **PostgreSQL**: Core business logic (trips, payments, users)
- **Redis**: Driver location caching (sub-second updates)
- **Cassandra**: Trip logs, analytics data (high volume writes)
- **MySQL**: Financial reconciliation (strong consistency)

**Why this works**: Polyglot persistence - right tool for each job

#### Example 3: Startup E-commerce Platform
**Problem**: Limited team, rapid feature development needed
**Solution**: Start with **PostgreSQL** for everything
- Products, users, orders, inventory
- JSON columns for flexible product attributes
- Later: Add Redis for caching, Elasticsearch for search

**Why this works**: Single technology to learn, PostgreSQL handles variety well

### Common Selection Mistakes

**Mistake 1**: "NoSQL is always faster"
- **Reality**: SQL databases can be extremely fast with proper indexing
- **Example**: PostgreSQL with proper indexes often outperforms MongoDB

**Mistake 2**: "We need to scale, so NoSQL"
- **Reality**: Most applications never reach web scale
- **Better**: Start simple, scale when you actually need to

**Mistake 3**: "One database for everything"
- **Reality**: Different data has different requirements
- **Better**: Polyglot persistence - use multiple databases

**Mistake 4**: "Latest technology is always better"
- **Reality**: Mature technologies have fewer surprises
- **Better**: Boring technology for critical systems

### Interview Tips for Database Selection

**Common Questions**:
- "How would you design the database for Instagram?"
- "Why would you choose MongoDB over PostgreSQL?"
- "When would you use Redis vs Memcached?"

**How to Answer**:
1. **Ask clarifying questions** about scale, consistency needs, budget
2. **Start with requirements** before jumping to solutions
3. **Explain trade-offs** - every choice has pros and cons
4. **Consider operational complexity** - who will maintain this?
5. **Think about the team** - what do they know?

**Sample Answer Structure**:
```
"For an Instagram-like app, I'd consider:
- User profiles: PostgreSQL (structured, relationships)
- Photo metadata: PostgreSQL (consistency for likes/comments)
- Photo storage: S3/CloudFront (not database)
- Feed generation: Redis (caching, performance)
- Analytics: Cassandra (high write volume)

I'd start with PostgreSQL + Redis and add Cassandra only when write volume justifies the complexity."
```
